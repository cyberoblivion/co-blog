# Project Context for Claude

Please read and follow the instructions in `AI_GUIDELINES.md` at the root of this repository.

That file contains:
- Project overview and goals
- Coding and design conventions
- Preferred tone for comments and commit messages

When generating or editing code, Claude should use those rules as the authoritative source.
