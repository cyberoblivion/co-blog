# Welcome
Welcome to CyberOblivion, the clandestine enclave where the shadows of hacking merge with the pragmatism of business. Here, we tread the murky waters of software development, systems engineering, and networking with the cunning of a hacker and the strategic foresight of a business magnate.

## Our Focus
Enter our digital fortress as we plunge into the depths of version control with Git, wielding its power to sculpt code with ruthless precision. AWX becomes our dark conductor, orchestrating the silent machinations that define our infrastructure.

## Venturing Deeper
But our journey is a descent into darkness. We navigate the abyss, surveilling our domain with Zabbix and Graylog, ensuring that every whisper of data is accounted for. Zerotier becomes our cloak of shadows, weaving connections unseen by the prying eyes of traditional networks.

## Collaboration and Code
Join us as we navigate the labyrinthine depths of technology, unraveling the mysteries of GitHub and GitLab, where collaboration is a dance of shadows and code is our currency. OpenStack and Kubernetes become our arenas, where we shape clouds and containers to our sinister designs.

## Fortifying Defenses
But beware, for the cyber realm is a battleground. We fortify our ramparts with the shields of pfSense and HAProxy, warding off the relentless onslaught of cyber threats. Greenbone and Bareos stand as grim sentinels, guarding our data with unyielding vigilance.

## Tools of the Trade
In our quest for dominance, we wield the tools of the underworld—IDEs like NetBeans and IntelliJ IDEA, password masters like Dashlane and KeePass—arming ourselves for the conflicts that lie ahead.

## Communication and Collaboration
And in the shadows, communication is our whisper in the night. Slack, Confluence, Jira, and Bitbucket become our clandestine rendezvous points, facilitating covert collaboration in the heart of the digital abyss.

## Join Us
So, seeker of shadows, if you dare to embrace the darkness veiled in a cloak of business cunning, CyberOblivion awaits. The path may be treacherous, but the spoils of victory are worth the risk. Join us, and together, we'll conquer the digital underworld. -->
