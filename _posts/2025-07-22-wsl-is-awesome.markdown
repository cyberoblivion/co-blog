## What is WSL 2 and Why Should You Care?

WSL 2 isn't just "Linux on Windows." It's a full Linux kernel running in a lightweight virtual machine that integrates seamlessly with Windows. You get:

- **Real Linux performance** - No more slow file operations or weird compatibility issues
- **Native Unix tooling** - bash, ssh, git, podman, everything works as expected
- **Seamless integration** - Access Windows files from Linux and vice versa
- **Multiple distros** - Run Ubuntu, Debian, Amazon Linux, or any distribution simultaneously
- **Development-ready** - Perfect for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) and other tools that run better in Linux

Think of it as having a Linux workstation that lives inside your Windows machine, accessible instantly from any terminal.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- **Windows 11** (or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher)
- **WSL 2 installed** - If you haven't installed WSL yet, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
  ```powershell
  wsl --install
  ```
- **Administrator access** - Some steps require elevated privileges

To verify you're running WSL 2 (not version 1), open PowerShell and run:
```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```

Look for "VERSION 2" next to your distributions. If you see "VERSION 1", upgrade with:
```powershell
wsl --set-version <distro-name> 2
```

### Quick Install: Popular Distributions from Microsoft Store

The easiest way to install popular distributions is directly from the Microsoft Store or command line:

**From PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Ubuntu (most popular)
wsl --install -d Ubuntu

# Debian
wsl --install -d Debian

# See all available distributions
wsl --list --online
```

**From Microsoft Store:**
- [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv)
- [Debian](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9msvkqc78pk6)
- [Kali Linux](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pkr34tncv07)
- [openSUSE](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9njvjts82tjx)

These install with a single click and come pre-configured. However, for distributions not in the Store (like Amazon Linux, Fedora, or Rocky Linux), use the manual import process below.

## Installing Amazon Linux 2023 on WSL 2

While [Ubuntu](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9pdxgncfsczv) is the default WSL distribution, Amazon Linux 2023 is excellent for developers working with AWS or wanting an enterprise-focused distribution. You can also install [Fedora](https://github.com/fedora-cloud/docker-brew-fedora), [Rocky Linux](https://github.com/rocky-linux/sig-cloud-instance-images), and many other distributions using the same import process we'll cover below.

Here's how to install Amazon Linux 2023:

### Step 1: Download the Amazon Linux Container

Download the Amazon Linux 2023 container tarball from AWS:

[Amazon Linux 2023 Container Image](https://cdn.amazonlinux.com/al2023/os-images/2023.6.20241212.0/container/al2023-container-2023.6.20241212.0-x86_64.tar.xz)

Save it somewhere accessible, like `C:\WSL\`.

### Step 2: Create a Directory for Your Instance

Create a directory to hold the WSL instance filesystem:

```powershell
mkdir C:\WSL\AL2023
```

### Step 3: Import the Instance

Import the tarball as a new WSL instance:

```powershell
wsl --import al2023 C:\WSL\AL2023 C:\WSL\al2023-container-2023.6.20241212.0-x86_64.tar.xz
```

**Command breakdown:**
- `al2023` - The name of your WSL instance
- `C:\WSL\AL2023` - Directory where the filesystem will be stored
- `C:\WSL\al2023-container-...tar.xz` - Path to the downloaded tarball

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Naming Convention Tip:</strong>
    Notice how the instance name (<code>al2023</code>) and directory name (<code>AL2023</code>) match? This keeps things simple. When you run <code>wsl -d al2023</code>, you know exactly where its files live: <code>C:\WSL\AL2023</code>. No mental gymnastics trying to remember which directory holds which instance. This convention saves confusion when managing multiple WSL distributions.
    </div>
</div>

### Step 4: Start the Instance

Launch your new Amazon Linux instance:

```powershell
wsl -d al2023
```

You'll see error messages about missing packages. This is expected; the container image is minimal by design.

## Installing Essential Packages

The base Amazon Linux container is bare bones. Let's install the tools you need for development:

```bash
dnf -y install util-linux sudo passwd vi vim make gcc g++ git wget tar procps \
rsync iputils net-tools amazon-ec2-net-utils policycoreutils policycoreutils-python-utils \
selinux-policy-targeted setools bind-utils rpm-build rpmdevtools ncurses-devel libcurl-devel \
openssl openssh-server openssl-devel unixODBC unixODBC-devel firewalld
```

**What we're installing:**
- **Basic utilities**: `util-linux`, `passwd`, `vim`, `tar`, `procps`
- **Development tools**: `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, `git`, `ncurses-devel`
- **Network tools**: `iputils`, `net-tools`, `openssh-server`
- **Security tools**: `policycoreutils`, `selinux-policy-targeted`, `firewalld`
- **Build tools**: `rpm-build`, `rpmdevtools`

After installation completes, restart the instance:

```powershell
wsl --terminate al2023
wsl -d al2023
```

## Enabling systemd (For Testing Environments)

Most of the time, you won't need systemd for development work. However, if you're setting up a testing or staging environment where you need to run services and daemons (like SSH servers, Podman containers as services, or databases managed by systemd), here's how to enable it:

### Install systemd

```bash
sudo dnf install systemd
```

### Configure WSL to Use systemd

Create or edit `/etc/wsl.conf`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf
```

Add the following:

```ini
[boot]
systemd=true
```

### Restart the Instance

```powershell
wsl --terminate al2023
wsl -d al2023
```

When you reattach, systemd will be running. Verify with:

```bash
systemctl status
```

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Development vs Testing Instances:</strong>
    I typically keep systemd <strong>disabled</strong> on my development WSL instances. This keeps boot times fast and, more importantly, ensures graphical development tools (like GUI debuggers, database clients, and IDEs) work properly. I only enable systemd on dedicated testing/staging instances where I need to replicate production-like service management.
    </div>
</div>

## Creating a Non-Root User

Running as root is bad practice. Let's create a proper user account:

### Add a New User

```bash
sudo useradd -m -d /home/ben -G wheel ben
```

Replace `ben` with your desired username. The `-G wheel` flag adds the user to the admin group.

### Set a Password

```bash
sudo passwd ben
```

### Configure WSL to Use Your User by Default

Edit `/etc/wsl.conf`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf
```

Add or update the `[user]` section:

```ini
[user]
default = ben
```

### Optional: Enable Passwordless sudo

For convenience (use with caution), you can allow your user to run sudo without a password:

```bash
sudo visudo
```

Find the line:
```
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       ALL
```

Change it to:
```
%wheel  ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL
```

Save and exit. Restart the instance:

```powershell
wsl --terminate al2023
wsl -d al2023
```

You should now log in as your user automatically.

## Disabling Automatic /etc/hosts Generation

By default, WSL regenerates `/etc/hosts` on every restart, which can be annoying if you've made custom entries. To disable this:

Edit `/etc/wsl.conf`:

```bash
sudo vim /etc/wsl.conf
```

Add the following:

```ini
[network]
generateHosts = false
```

Restart the instance:

```powershell
wsl --terminate al2023
wsl -d al2023
```

Your `/etc/hosts` file will now persist across restarts.

## Developing with VS Code in WSL 2

VS Code has excellent WSL integration, but there are some crucial best practices to follow for optimal performance.

### The Right Way: Install VS Code on Windows

**DO THIS:**
- Install VS Code directly on Windows (not in WSL)
- Use the `code` command from your WSL terminal to launch VS Code
- Install the "Remote - WSL" extension in VS Code

**Example:**
```bash
# From inside WSL
cd ~/dev/projects/my-project
code .
```

This opens VS Code on Windows with your WSL files mounted properly.

### The Wrong Way: Avoid Windows-Mounted Directories

**DO NOT DO THIS:**
- Don't develop in `/mnt/c/Users/yourname/projects`
- Don't access Windows directories from WSL for active development
- Don't clone git repos into Windows and edit them from WSL

**Why?** File operations across the Windows/Linux boundary are **dramatically slower**. Every file read/write has to be translated between filesystems, which kills performance.

**Instead:**
- Clone and work on projects directly in WSL's filesystem: `~/dev/projects/`
- Use the exact directory structure from our [development environment guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/development-env-setup/)
- Access your projects via VS Code's WSL integration

### Performance Comparison

Here's the reality:

| Operation | Windows Mount (`/mnt/c`) | WSL Filesystem (`~`) |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| `npm install` | 2-5 minutes | 30 seconds |
| Git operations | Painfully slow | Native speed |
| File watching | Unreliable | Works perfectly |
| Build times | 3-4x slower | Full speed |

The difference is massive. Always work in WSL's native filesystem.

### Setting Up VS Code

1. **Install VS Code** on Windows from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. **Install the Remote - WSL extension:**
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Remote - WSL"
   - Click Install

3. **Open your project from WSL:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/dev/projects/my-project
   code .
   ```

VS Code will connect to your WSL instance automatically and you'll get full IntelliSense, debugging, and terminal integration.

### Installing Claude Code in WSL

[Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) is an AI-powered coding assistant that works exceptionally well in WSL environments. Here's how to set it up:

#### Install Claude Code in WSL

From your WSL terminal, run the installation script:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | sh
```

This installs Claude Code in your WSL instance, giving it native access to your Linux filesystem and tools.

#### Verify the Installation

```bash
claude --version
```

You should see the Claude Code version number, confirming it's installed correctly.

#### Install the Claude Code VS Code Extension

To integrate Claude Code with VS Code:

1. **Open VS Code** (already configured for WSL from above)

2. **Install the Claude Code extension:**
   - Open Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "Claude Code"
   - Click Install
   - Make sure it installs in WSL (you'll see "Install in WSL: Ubuntu" or similar)

3. **Authenticate Claude Code:**
   - Click the Claude icon in the VS Code sidebar
   - Follow the authentication prompts
   - Or run from terminal: `claude auth login`

![Claude Code in VS Code with WSL](/assets/wsl/vs-code-claude.png)

Once connected, you'll see the Claude Code interface in VS Code's sidebar, ready to assist with code generation, debugging, and analysis—all running natively in your WSL environment.

#### Using Claude Code in WSL

Once installed, Claude Code can:

```bash
# Generate code from natural language
claude "create a bash script to backup ~/dev to ~/backups"

# Analyze and improve existing code
claude "review this function for security issues" < script.py

# Debug issues
claude "why isn't this working?" < broken-script.sh

# From VS Code
# Use Ctrl+L (or Cmd+L on Mac) to open Claude Code chat
# Highlight code and ask Claude for help, refactoring, or explanations
```

**Why WSL makes Claude Code better:**

- **Faster file operations** - Claude can read and analyze your codebase quickly
- **Native toolchain access** - Claude can run tests, build tools, and linters directly
- **Better shell integration** - Commands and scripts work as expected in Linux
- **Full Unix tooling** - Access to grep, sed, awk, and all standard Linux utilities
- **No path translation issues** - Everything just works without Windows/Linux path conversions

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Performance Tip:</strong>
    Claude Code performs significantly better when working with files in WSL's native filesystem (<code>~/dev/projects</code>) rather than Windows mounts (<code>/mnt/c</code>). Keep your projects in WSL for the best experience.
    </div>
</div>

## Complete /etc/wsl.conf Reference

Here's a complete `/etc/wsl.conf` with all the settings we've configured:

```ini
[boot]
systemd=true

[user]
default = ben

[network]
generateHosts = false
```

You can add additional settings as needed. Check the [official WSL configuration documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config) for more options.

## Configuring WSL 2 Resource Limits with .wslconfig

By default, WSL 2 can use up to 50% of your total system memory and all available CPU cores. If you're running resource-intensive workloads or want more control over WSL's resource allocation, you can configure limits using `.wslconfig`.

### Creating .wslconfig

Create or edit `C:\Users\YourName\.wslconfig` in Windows (not in WSL):

**From PowerShell:**
```powershell
notepad $env:USERPROFILE\.wslconfig
```

**Or from WSL:**
```bash
notepad.exe /mnt/c/Users/YourName/.wslconfig
```

### Example .wslconfig Configuration

```ini
[wsl2]
# Limit memory to 8GB (adjust based on your needs)
memory=8GB

# Limit CPU cores to 4
processors=4

# Set swap size to 2GB
swap=2GB

# Disable swap file (optional, for maximum performance)
# swap=0

# How much swap space to allocate (percentage of memory)
swapfile=%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\swap.vhdx

# Enable localhost forwarding (allows accessing WSL services from Windows)
localhostForwarding=true
```

### Understanding the Settings

**Memory Limits:**
- `memory=8GB` - Caps WSL 2 at 8GB of RAM
- Useful if you run Windows applications alongside WSL
- Default is 50% of total RAM or 8GB, whichever is less

**CPU Limits:**
- `processors=4` - Limits WSL to 4 CPU cores
- Useful for preventing WSL from monopolizing CPU during builds
- Default is all available processors

**Swap Configuration:**
- `swap=2GB` - Sets swap file size
- `swap=0` - Disables swap entirely (better performance but higher memory pressure)
- Default is 25% of memory size

**When to Adjust These Settings:**

- **Heavy builds** - Increase memory and processors for faster compilation
- **Resource constraints** - Limit WSL if you need RAM/CPU for Windows applications
- **Multiple WSL instances** - Reduce limits if running several distributions simultaneously
- **Performance tuning** - Disable swap for maximum speed (ensure adequate RAM)

### Apply the Changes

After editing `.wslconfig`, restart WSL completely:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
wsl -d al2023
```

Your new resource limits will take effect immediately.

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Performance Note:</strong>
    The <code>.wslconfig</code> file applies globally to ALL WSL 2 distributions on your system. If you run multiple distros simultaneously, they share these resource limits. Per-instance configuration is done via <code>/etc/wsl.conf</code> inside each distribution.
    </div>
</div>

## Bringing Your Linux Dev Environment to WSL

Remember the [development environment setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/development-env-setup/) we covered? It works perfectly in WSL. Here's how to migrate:

### 1. Create Your Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p ~/dev/projects ~/dev/utils
```

### 2. Copy Your Dotfiles

If you have dotfiles on another Linux machine:

```bash
# From your Linux machine
scp ~/.bashrc ~/.gitconfig youruser@yourwindowspc:/tmp/

# From WSL
cp /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Downloads/.bashrc ~/
cp /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Downloads/.gitconfig ~/
```

Or just recreate them following the guide.

### 3. Install Development Tools

```bash
# Git (already installed above)
# Node.js
curl -fsSL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | sudo bash -
sudo dnf install nodejs

# Python
sudo dnf install python3 python3-pip

# Podman (rootless container management)
sudo dnf install podman

# Optional: Set up Podman socket for Docker compatibility
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

### 4. Clone Your Projects

```bash
cd ~/dev/projects
git clone git@github.com:yourname/your-project.git
```

You're now running the same environment across Windows (via WSL), Linux VMs, and cloud instances.

## Windows Terminal: Your WSL Command Center

One of the best features of modern Windows is **Windows Terminal** (or the new PowerShell terminal). It provides a dropdown menu that lets you quickly switch between all your WSL distributions, PowerShell, Command Prompt, and any other shells you have installed.

![Windows Terminal WSL Dropdown](/assets/wsl/wsl-dropdown.png)

### Quick Access to All Your WSL Instances

The dropdown menu (accessible via the `+` button or `Ctrl+Shift+Space`) shows:
- All your WSL distributions (Ubuntu, Amazon Linux, Debian, etc.)
- PowerShell and Command Prompt
- Azure Cloud Shell (if configured)
- Any custom profiles you've created

This makes it incredibly easy to:
- **Run multiple distributions simultaneously** - Have Ubuntu running tests while you develop in Amazon Linux
- **Switch contexts instantly** - Jump from PowerShell to your WSL environment in one click
- **Organize your workflow** - Open different projects in different WSL instances

### Customizing Your Terminal Profiles

You can customize each WSL profile in Windows Terminal with:
- Custom icons and colors
- Different starting directories
- Custom fonts and themes
- Keyboard shortcuts for each profile

To customize, click the dropdown arrow → Settings (or press `Ctrl+,`), then edit your WSL profiles. For example, you might set your Amazon Linux instance to always start in `~/dev/projects`.

This integration makes WSL feel like a first-class citizen in Windows, not an add-on. You're never more than a click away from any of your Linux environments.

## Tips and Troubleshooting

### Accessing Windows Files from WSL

Windows drives are mounted under `/mnt/`:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents
```

But remember: **don't develop here**. Use this for moving files, not active work.

### Accessing WSL Files from Windows

Your WSL filesystem is accessible from Windows at:

```
\\wsl$\al2023\home\ben\
```

You can browse it in File Explorer or map it as a network drive.

### Create Symlinks to Windows Directories for Easier Access

Typing `/mnt/c/Users/YourName/Documents` every time gets old fast. I set up symlinks in my home directory that point to my Windows Documents and Downloads folders for quick access:

```bash
# Create symlinks to Windows user directories
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/ben/Documents ~/Documents
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/ben/Downloads ~/Downloads
ln -s /mnt/c/Users/ben/Desktop ~/Desktop
```

Now you can quickly access these directories:

```bash
# Copy a file from Windows Downloads
cp ~/Downloads/data.csv ~/dev/projects/my-project/

# Move files to Windows Documents for sharing
cp analysis-results.txt ~/Documents/

# Check what's on your Windows Desktop
ls ~/Desktop
```

**Why this is useful:**
- **Faster navigation** - `~/Downloads` instead of `/mnt/c/Users/ben/Downloads`
- **Easier file transfer** - Quickly grab files downloaded in Windows browsers
- **Share results** - Copy analysis or build artifacts to Documents for easy Windows access
- **Tab completion** - Your shell's autocomplete works naturally with `~/Downloads`

This bridges the gap between your WSL development environment and Windows file management without the hassle of long paths.

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Remember:</strong>
    These symlinks are just for <strong>file transfer and access</strong>, not active development. Still develop in <code>~/dev/projects</code> for best performance, but use these links when you need to quickly grab or share files with Windows.
    </div>
</div>

### Running Windows Applications from WSL

One of the most powerful features of WSL is the ability to run Windows executables directly from your Linux command line. WSL automatically appends Windows paths to your Linux `$PATH`, giving you access to all your Windows applications.

Check your path in WSL:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

![WSL PATH with Windows Executables](/assets/wsl/wsl-path.png)

Notice the `/mnt/c/Windows/System32` and other Windows directories? This means you can:

**Run Windows executables from Linux:**
```bash
# Open Windows Explorer from WSL
explorer.exe .

# Launch VS Code on Windows from WSL
code .

# Run PowerShell commands
powershell.exe -Command "Get-Process"

# Open files in Windows applications
notepad.exe myfile.txt

# Even run Windows GUI applications
calc.exe
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Seamless integration** - Mix Linux and Windows tools in the same workflow
- **Best of both worlds** - Use Linux CLI tools for processing, Windows GUI tools for viewing
- **Bridge between systems** - Pass data between Linux and Windows applications easily

For example, you might process logs with `grep` and `awk` in Linux, then open the results in Excel:
```bash
cat app.log | grep ERROR | awk '{print $1,$2,$5}' > errors.csv
explorer.exe errors.csv  # Opens in Excel
```

<div class="info-panel">
  <div class="info-icon">&#8505;</div>
    <div class="info-content">
    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong>
    Always include the <code>.exe</code> extension when calling Windows executables from WSL. This helps the shell distinguish between Linux and Windows commands.
    </div>
</div>

### Restarting WSL Completely

If things get weird:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
wsl -d al2023
```

This fully restarts the WSL virtual machine.

### Checking WSL Memory Usage

```powershell
wsl --list --verbose
```

WSL 2 uses dynamic memory allocation. It'll use what it needs and release it when done.

### Running Multiple Distributions

You can have multiple WSL instances running simultaneously:

```powershell
wsl -d Ubuntu
wsl -d al2023
wsl -d Debian
```

Each is completely isolated with its own filesystem and packages.

## Why This Matters for Tools Like Claude Code

If you read our [previous post about development environments]({{ site.baseurl }}/howto/development-env-setup/), you know we mentioned that tools like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) run significantly better in Linux. Here's why WSL 2 makes this work:

- **Native Linux kernel** - Claude Code gets full Linux performance
- **Real Unix semantics** - File permissions, signals, and process management work correctly
- **Better shell integration** - bash, zsh, and other shells work as expected
- **Faster file operations** - Critical for AI tools that read/analyze codebases
- **Native toolchain** - gcc, make, and build tools work without translation layers

The difference is dramatic. Claude Code operations that might timeout or struggle on native Windows work flawlessly in WSL 2.

## Conclusion

WSL 2 bridges the gap between Windows and Linux development without compromise. You get:

- **Native Linux performance** in a Windows environment
- **Seamless VS Code integration** for the best of both worlds
- **Portable development environments** that work everywhere
- **Professional tooling** that actually works

Whether you're developing for cloud infrastructure, building containerized applications, or just want the Unix command line without leaving Windows, WSL 2 delivers.

Set it up once, configure it right, and you'll never look back.
